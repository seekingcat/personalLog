### Day 4: May 24, 2024

**Today's Progress**:

* Reviewed Callbacks and Array Methods in WDB
* Worked on Section 25 - DOM Events in WDB

**Thoughts** Thinking that as I'm moving forward I should set up a healthy habit of reviewing what I've gone over so I don't keep piling knowledge on top of shaky knowledge.
Gone over array Methods like .forEach(), .map(), .filter(), .reduce(), .some(), .every(). Reviewed arrow functions and writing implicit returns, as well as the keyword *this* and its quirks in arrow functions.
Section 25 of WDB - lessons 259 - 266. event listening and handling

### Day 5: May 25, 2024

**Today's Progress**:

* Reviewed different types of event handling - mouse, keyboard, form
* Did event handling exercises to consolidate understanding of the different workflows, eg single page workflows

Went over the use of the keyword *this* and their use in event handling, they can be used to denote the element being acted upon when used as a separate callback and called in an event. Looked at pointer events, keyboard events and form events. Looked at preventing forms from submitting to another page, so that you can manipulate the data on a single page. Looked at capturing keyboard locations or keyboard key values using e.code and e.key.

**Thoughts**: The lessons took a little time to implement, so I had to work slowly today over a section that I had previously completed but I think it's worth the time to consolidate the knowledge because this will be fundamental understanding for manipulating large data forms or APIs later on in the course. I think the concepts are starting to crystalise in my head but I just struggle with remembering all the syntax. I think that it will only become second nature the more I use the syntax

### Day 6: May 26, 2024

**Today's Progress**:

* Change events and input events
* Event bubbling
* Event delegation

**Thoughts**: Started working on the scorekeeper exercise without coding along, hoping that I was able to crack it without help from the instructor. Got stopped at the very first step trying to initialise a counter. This seems the simplest thing and I'm rather frustrated that I can't seem to get this to work. I get the first counter to work, but when I click the button for the second counter to start at 0, the second counter just picks up from where the first counter has left off rather than starting from 0. I know this is because I've initialised the counter outside of a function, but when I try to put it into a function so I'm not duplicating my code, it doesn't seem to work, the counter goes up by one then stops. This is so easy and I know it is, so I can't believe I was stuck right at the very beginning. But at least I was able to click to change my spans in my scorekeeper and I was able to reset each span with a reset button. i'm also able to add classes to each element on a button click so that's at least some progress. Frustrated.

### Day 7: May 27. 2024

**Today's Progress**:

* Learning about promises
* Async and await
* Complete scorekeeper exercise

**Thoughts**: I was able to complete my scorekeeper without looking at the code through and I'm really proud of being able to achieve that. Learned that sometimes it's good to step away from the learning environment and all of the knowledge and look at the problem with fresh eyes. I believe that's what I will have to do with today's learning because understanding promises and async/await keywords and handling errors was really like wading through murky waters and I'm not sure at all what it all means. I think the concepts are really rather simple and the teaching method might have been a bit convoluted, but I think it's also just because the concepts are new. Will have to revisit all of section 27 of WDB tomorrow.

### Day 8: May 28, 2024

**Today's Progress**:

* Ajax and APIs
* Understanding JSON
* Using Hoppscotch
* Using Fetch and Axios
* Status codes, headers and query strings

**Thoughts**: Really only understood the concepts on a surface level. Will have to go back and review section 27 on promises and async/await, try/catch, just so that I've firmed it up in my head. But also it might be that it's better to work with real life examples rather than fake requests, which is how the concepts are being taught. Nevertheless, it's starting to get to the really fun part of the course where it's less conceptual and more about how information is parsed and utilised in the real world. Which means I can make useful websites with some functionality.

### Day 9: May 29, 2024

**Today's Progress**:

* More practice with Axios
* OOP and classes
* Introduction to Node and installation
* Installing and using packages

**Thoughts**: Managed to implement a very basic quote generator using axios, but feel I require some more practice with it to make it second nature. But it worked, there's no styling, but I'm happy that I was able to extract the information that I needed and made something useable, even if it's just a click listener at the moment. Pushed ahead with node installation and requiring and installing packages. Seems pretty basic at the moment, but will revise the material. Object Oriented programming and classes and prototypes was a difficult section, so will have to revisit that as well.

### Day 10: May 30, 2024

**Today's Progress**:

* Language guesser challenge
* Started learning about Express

**Thoughts**: Did the language detector exercise on my own before watching the code through and managed to get it to work. Getting comfortable with using node and npm and started working with Express. Spending time revisiting older topics like Javascript advanced methods and object oriented programming again, as well as async/await functions and error handling with try/catch.

### Day 12: June 1, 2024

**Today's Progress**:
* Express routing basics, path parameters, query strings
* Templating, installing EJS
* EJS views directory, passing data to templates, conditionals and loops

**Thoughts**: Will have to spend more time with this just to make sure I understand the req and res objects that are returned. Also have to make sure I understand the use of 'path' in EJS, although it looks like syntax that's just normal for each ejs file. Enjoying this beginning look at frameworks, and need to read docs for templating engines to see if I can understand how they work.

### Day 15: June 4, 2024

**Today's Progress**:

Sections 36 and 37 of Colt's Web Developer Bootcamp, learning about Mongo and connecting with Mongoose. Learning CRUD methods with both. Dense sections, but pretty straightforward. Figuring out that you never ever truly stop reading documentation. Today was an installing and experimenting day. Looking forward to getting to tie it all in with the browser.

### Day 17: June 6, 2024

**Today's Progress**:

Started on the massive Yelp-Camp challenge, so getting practice with setting up express, ejs, mongoose and making new schema. Progress will slow in terms of new learning as I'm now at the point where I will be practicing the skills rather than taking on new ones. Also started learning the basics of React.

### Day 20: June 9, 2024

**Today's Progress**:

A slow day, stuck at a point with my campground project, so spent the day setting up some flashcards about array methods, solving some Codewars problems, watching some sql related twitch streams and going back over some basic concepts. Sometimes review days are good.

### Day 27: June 16, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 

Completed Class 6 exercises and started reading Shay Howe Advanced HTML.

**Thoughts**: It seems folly to have gone all the way back to the beginning but I'm actually really glad that I have a cohort of sorts to go through this information and that it feels as if there's a class that's going through it together. I'm understanding things better, not just running through the basics and having only a shallow understanding of the material. The repetition and practice is consolidating the material in my understanding and I'm happy to actually slow the pace. I'll get back to Express and Mongoose soon enough, but it was starting to feel as if I was filling my head with advanced material when I hadn't even mastered the basics.

### Day 28: June 17, 2024

**Today's Progress**:

Revisited the basics of responsive web design. This is a slow day in terms of coding, so I was just able to do some anki and watch a bit of my #100devs Class 7, but it really was a day off as I spent most of the day in the reading for the TV show that I'm filming in a week's time. I will be looking back to my Udemy course tomorrow and completing Shay Howe Advanced including revision cards so I can make sure I keep up with what I've already learned and not lose sight of it.
